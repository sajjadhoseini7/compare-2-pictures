These codes are developed to calculate the differences between two pictures. The process involves several steps:

    Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison:
        The code compares each pixel in the first image with the corresponding pixel in the second image. This comparison is typically done by calculating the absolute difference between the pixel values.

    Summing the Differences:
        After computing the differences for all corresponding pixels, the code sums up these differences to get a total difference value. This total represents the cumulative deviation between the two images.

    Averaging the Differences:
        To normalize the difference and make it meaningful, the total difference is divided by the total number of pixels in the images. This step provides an average difference per pixel.

    Calculating the Percentage Difference:
        Finally, the code converts the average difference into a percentage. This percentage indicates how different the two images are, making it easier to understand the extent of the variation at a glance.

Here is a more detailed description of each step in the process:

Step 1: Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison

    Each pixel in an image is represented by color values (typically in RGB or Gray format). The code iterates through every pixel in the two images, computing the absolute difference between the corresponding pixels'     color values.

Step 2: Summing the Differences

    The computed differences from the previous step are aggregated. This total difference is a cumulative measure of how much the two images deviate from each other across all pixels.

Step 3: Averaging the Differences

    To provide a normalized measure, the total difference is divided by the number of pixels. This average difference per pixel provides a more standardized view of the variation between the images.

Step 4: Calculating the Percentage Difference

    The average difference is then expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible difference (which is typically 255 for an 8-bit color depth per channel). This percentage provides a clear, intuitive indication of       how different the two images are.
